1️⃣ AI in Healthcare is Hard—How Do You Handle Accuracy & Liability?

	Investor: “You’re making some bold claims about near 100% accuracy. What happens if AMI gets a diagnosis wrong? Who’s liable?”

Answer:
Great question, and we take this very seriously. AMI is not a replacement for doctors—it’s an AI-powered medical assistant that provides evidence-based guidance, not direct prescriptions or legally binding diagnoses.

We’ve built MedRank™, a proprietary AI that filters out biased or low-quality studies, ensuring that AMI’s recommendations are grounded in peer-reviewed, reproducible medical science.

Regulatory Strategy? We’re positioning AMI as a clinical decision-support tool, which means it doesn’t require full FDA approval at this stage. However, as we scale, we’re already mapping out regulatory pathways for AI-driven diagnostics, ensuring we stay ahead of compliance requirements.

Risk Mitigation?
	•	Every response from AMI is traceable back to validated sources—users and doctors can always see why a recommendation is made.
	•	We don’t “guess”—if data is insufficient, AMI won’t fabricate an answer, it will redirect users to human doctors.
	•	Legal protections: AMI operates within HIPAA and GDPR frameworks, ensuring full compliance with health data regulations.

If you look at the AI-health landscape, companies like Ada Health and IBM Watson struggled because they lacked clinical depth and physician buy-in. We’re solving that from day one.

2️⃣ Why Will Doctors Actually Use This?

	Investor: “Doctors are notorious for resisting new tech. Why would they trust AMI?”

Answer:
You’re absolutely right—most AI solutions fail because they try to replace doctors instead of augmenting them.

Here’s why doctors will love AMI:
	•	Time-Saving: Physicians spend two hours on paperwork for every one hour with patients. AMI eliminates redundant admin work, saving them 5–10 hours per week.
	•	Cross-Specialty Intelligence: AMI bridges the gaps between disciplines—a cardiologist and endocrinologist don’t always collaborate, but AMI sees the bigger picture.
	•	Clinical Decision Support: Instead of replacing doctors, AMI acts as an AI medical co-pilot, helping with triage, cross-checking diagnoses, and highlighting new research.

Real-world validation? We’ve already beta-tested AMI with 25+ physicians, achieving 94% diagnostic accuracy. Several doctors in our pilot are already requesting long-term integrations.

3️⃣ How Will You Acquire and Retain Users?

	Investor: “Healthcare is a nightmare for user acquisition. How do you plan to grow?”

Answer:
We’re taking a bottom-up approach—starting with high-intent, engaged users rather than blasting mass marketing.
	1.	Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) via Content:
	•	YouTube & Newsletters: Health-focused content builds trust and educates users, driving organic traffic to AMI.
	•	Avatar-Based Engagement: Think of AMI’s avatar as a digital Dr. Oz—except real science, no fluff.
	2.	Strategic Partnerships:
	•	Medicaid & Employer Health Plans → AMI as an included benefit.
	•	Hospital Integrations → Doctors recommend AMI to patients, rather than us convincing patients to try AI.
	3.	Low-Friction Entry Point:
	•	Supplements & biomarker testing offer a “gateway” product that transitions users into higher-value AI-driven subscriptions.

Retention?
	•	AMI doesn’t just diagnose—it keeps users engaged daily with proactive health optimization.
	•	User-driven data feedback loop: The more users engage, the more personalized AMI becomes—creating stickiness and long-term value.

CAC? We estimate under $40 per acquired user, with an LTV of $600+ over 3 years.

4️⃣ The $72B TAM Sounds Nice, But How Much Can You Realistically Capture?

	Investor: “What’s your actual Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) in 3 years?”

Answer:
Great question. Let’s break it down:
	•	Year 1 Goal: 50K paying users → $12M ARR.
	•	Year 2 Goal: 250K paying users → $60M ARR.
	•	Year 3 Goal: 1M+ paying users → $240M ARR.

We expect to capture ~3% of our SOM (~1M users) within 5 years. That alone puts us at $250M+ revenue potential.

5️⃣ Competitors—What’s Stopping Google from Killing You?

	Investor: “What’s your true defensibility?”

Answer:
Google, Amazon, and Apple have tried AI in healthcare, but they lack specialized, medical-grade intelligence.

AMI’s defensive moats:
	•	MedRank™ AI: Our proprietary medical-ranking system filters out unreliable studies—something no competitor has at scale.
	•	Personalized, Contextualized Health AI: Google can answer health questions, but it doesn’t integrate real-time biomarkers, wearables, or personal medical history like AMI does.
	•	Doctor Buy-In: We’re building AMI into clinical workflows—something Big Tech hasn’t cracked.

Simply put: We go deeper than symptom-checkers, and we build trust where Big Tech fails.

⸻

6️⃣ Where’s the Traction?

	Investor: “Have any doctors or users actually paid for this yet?”

Answer:
Yes—we have thousands of engaged early users and multiple pilot agreements in motion.
	•	94% accuracy in beta tests with doctors.
	•	Early-stage subscription revenue from direct users.
	•	Preliminary enterprise interest from healthcare networks.

Within 6 months of funding, we expect to convert 10% of pilot users into full-time paid subscribers.
